ISSUE 1

Create an importer for characters
I realized that create the characters using the form is incredibly slow and 
error prone, so we'd need to be able to create characters massively. I think 
using a CSV file where we can have all the fields at once speed our job up and 
does not seem like a very time consuming task. Each column represents a field in
the database, and each row a character to be created.
The interface doesn't to be very nice at first, it is more important to be done
right now, so we can go on with all the data importation.
However an essential feature should be to see the result of the import by row.
If everything goes fine we can show a link to the created character, otherwise
show what error occurred during the creation. This way we can create a new file
with only the failed rows, fix them and upload them again until every character
is correctly created.

ISSUE 2

We want to change the UI. The teach team has decided to use React.js for the 
views.
We want the app to be a single page application. 
On this first step we want start with the Houses CRUD. Develop the Houses list
the House details and the creation/edit form as react components. Note that as
a single page application would be greate don't have to reload the pages while
navigating through the houses CRUD pages. Please do it considering that it's a
view that will be redisegned soon.

In the Houses creation/edit form change the 'Sigil url' field for a react
component that perform a images search (using for example [Pixabay API]
(https://pixabay.com/api/docs)), display the first 4 results, and give the user
the ability to choose and save an image.
